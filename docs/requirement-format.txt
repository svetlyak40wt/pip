The requirements file format
============================

The requirements file is what poacheggs uses to install packages.
This document describes that format.

Each line of the requirements file indicates something to be
installed.  For example::

    MyPackage==3.0

tells poacheggs to install the 3.0 version of MyPackage.  

You can also install a package in an "editable" form.  This puts the
source code into ``src/distname`` (making the name lower case) and
runs ``python setup.py develop`` on the package.  To indicate
editable, use ``-e``, like::

    -e svn+http://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject/trunk#egg=MyProject

The ``#egg=MyProject`` part is important, because while you can
install simply given the svn location, the project name is useful in
other places.

If you need to give poacheggs (and by association easy_install) hints
about where to find a package, you can use the ``-f``
(``--find-links``) option, like::

    -f http://someserver.org/MyPackage-3.0.tar.gz

If the package is named like ``PackageName-Version.tar.gz`` (or a zip)
then you don't need ``#egg=...``.  Note that you cannot provide
multiple ``-f`` arguments to easy_install, but you can in a
requirements file (they all get concatenated into a single ``-f`` for
easy_install).

Version Control
---------------

Right now poacheggs only knows Subversion.  I hope to add Mercurial in
the not-too-distant future, as that system in particular is used by
quite a few open source Python projects (once that's added, support
for Bazaar, git, etc. will probably be easy).

You can also give specific revisions to an SVN URL, like::

    -e svn+http://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject/trunk@2019

which will check out revision 2019.  ``@{20080101}`` would also check
out the revision from 2008-01-01.  You can only check out specific
revisions using ``-e svn+...``.
