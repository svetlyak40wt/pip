Poach Eggs
==========

This script installs a set of packages at once using
``easy_install``.  It improves on the output of easy_install and also
allows you to define a set of working packages, separately from the
exact requirements of the packages themselves.

This replicates the ``--requirements`` functionality of `workingenv
<http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/workingenv.py>`_, but you don't
have to use workingenv to use this; in particular it works well with
`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.

Requirements File Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of the requirements file is meant to be compatible with
workingenv requirements files and fassembler requirements files.  In
brief, "(-f) works like easy_install find_links, (-r) will pull in
another requirements file, and (-e) will flag a pkg to be checkouted and
installed development style."

For more information on the requirements file format, see:
