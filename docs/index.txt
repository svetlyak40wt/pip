Poach Eggs
==========

This script installs a set of packages at once using
``easy_install``.  It improves on the output of easy_install and also
allows you to define a set of working packages, separately from the
exact requirements of the packages themselves.

This replicates the ``--requirements`` functionality of `workingenv
<http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/workingenv.py>`_, but you don't
have to use workingenv to use this; in particular it works well with
`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.
