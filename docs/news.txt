News for pyinstall
==================

svn trunk
---------

* Added an option ``--install-option`` to pass options to pass
  arguments to ``setup.py install``

0.1.3
-----

* Always use ``svn checkout`` (not ``export``) so that
  ``tag_svn_revision`` settings give the revision of the package.

* Don't update checkouts that came from ``.pybundle`` files.

0.1.2
-----

* Improve error text when there are errors fetching HTML pages when
  seeking packages.

* Improve bundles: include empty directories, make them work with
  editable packages.

* If you use ``-E env`` and the environment ``env/`` doesn't exist, a
  new virtual environment will be created.

* Fix ``dependency_links`` for finding packages.

0.1.1
-----

* Fixed a NameError exception when running pyinstall outside of a
  virtualenv environment.

* Added HTTP proxy support (from Prabhu Ramachandran)

* Fixed use of ``hashlib.md5`` on python2.5+ (also from Prabhu
  Ramachandran)
