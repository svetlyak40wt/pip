* Renamed the script from ``poach-eggs`` to ``poacheggs`` (to more
  closely match the filename ``poacheggs.py``).
* Refactored the code internally, added tests, generally improved the
  codebase.
* Made the script into a single file ``poacheggs.py`` that can be run
  without having to be installed; like ``virtualenv.py`` this makes
  bootstrapping easier.
* Added the ``-E`` option to run poacheggs inside a virtualenv
  environment.

0.2
~~~

* First real public release.
